## Scripts

start.sh --> Builds new vision instance on nano. Should only be run on completely new Jetsons with JetPack OS installed.

open.sh --> Starts Vision instance on nano assuming start has already been run.

open-u.sh --> Same as open.sh but does not pull GitHub repository (should be run when pulling is not possible)

test-86.sh --> Starts already running instance on x86 architectures. (Check Specific Paths and Change as necessary because they will be different per machine).
