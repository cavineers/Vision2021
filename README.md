# 2021_ObjectDetection_Vision
2021 FIRST FRC Galactic Search Mission Vision Code. This code will be able to run real time object detection for the playing field using a RPI (4) and TensorFlow Lite. All the resources and vision code shall be updated as more information becomes available.

## Resources / Research
**Note:** this list will be updated as more resources become available...

[Vision on TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/object_detection/overview#model_customization)\
[TensorFlow Models GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models)\
[Tranfer Learning with TensorFlow Video Resource](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/device-based-models-tensorflow/transfer-learning-with-tflite-y7OPK)\
[Already Trained TensorFlow Models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md#pixel4-edge-tpu-models)

## Methods
1. We will be using a method called transfer learning to use a previously trained TensorFlow Model to fit our specific requirments.
2. We can also train a custom model from scratch but that would require more work than the above option but still one that is available.
